# Welcome to the RemoteSwitchController Project

In this project we connect a XBox Pro Controller to a Nintendo Switch that can be anywhere in the world.
To accomblish this we wrote a Client and Server to Stream the Controller data from one PC to another one that gives this data to a micocontroller to simulate a Ninendo Switch Pro Controller.



## Why

To answer the why in the project my friend has no Nindendo Switch and I wanted to play some local multiplayer games with him.
So we decided to Code this project together to play together on my Nintendo Switch.

## Current Features

+ All button / joystick 1 to 1 connectivity
+ Pressing the start button for 2 secounds presses the Pro Controller Home button.

## Planned Features / Future deployments

+ As a mapper for using a keyboard and mouse on the Nintendo Switch
+ Compatibility for other Controllers.
+ A Custom PCB for the controller simulation
